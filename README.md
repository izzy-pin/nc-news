# news rn ðŸ“°

## What's it about?

news rn is a social news and discussion site built using React.

Currently, the site has a default "logged in" user that can up and down vote articles and comments and also post and delete their own comments.

news rn's articles are divided into topics. Users can sort topics by date created and popularity and can use pagination to navigate through a topic's available articles. Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted and has its own commments section.

I have tried to build the app's components with scalability in mind, and its structure / functionality will change as I continue to improve and refactor it.
